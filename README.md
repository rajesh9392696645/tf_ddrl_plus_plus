To start coding and get the system running, you should follow a typical development workflow: setup, configuration, training, and deployment.
1. Setup the EnvironmentThe very first step is to ensure your development environment has all the necessary dependencies.
Install Prerequisites:Use the provided file to install the required Python libraries.Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
This will likely install libraries like TensorFlow (as suggested by the tf_ prefix and file names), NumPy, NetworkX, and others.
2. Configure the SystemNext, you need to set the hyper-parameters and environment details for your experiments.
3. Edit config.yaml:This file contains all the main settings.
4. You should open it and adjust parameters like:Hyperparameters: Learning rates, batch sizes, discount factor clipping values, etc.
5. Environment Settings: The complexity or size of the scheduling problems (e.g., number of tasks, available resources).
6. Logging/Checkpoint Paths: Where models and logs will be saved.Use config_loader.py: The src/utils/config_loader.py is responsible for reading this file, so ensure the file structure and syntax are correct.
7. 3. Train the Teacher Agent (Cloud Training)The core idea is to train a complex Teacher Network using a powerful DRL algorithm, which will later "teach" a simpler Student Network.
   4. Start Training:Use the primary entry point script for the training process. This script implements the logic from Chapter 5.
   5. python main_cloud_trainer.py
Key Modules Involved in Training:src/env/ioht_scheduler_env.py: Provides the environment for the agent to interact with.src/arch/teacher_network.py:
Defines the high-capacity DRL policy/value network (the Teacher).src/arch/graph_transformer.py:
Implements the Sparse Graph-Transformer (SGT) Encoder, which is likely a key feature of the Teacher network for processing the graph-structured environment
state.src/core/ppo_agent.py: Contains the main $\text{PPO}$ (Proximal Policy Optimization) training loop.src/core/per_buffer.py: Manages the Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) mechanism for sampling training data.
4. Distill and Deploy the Student Agent (Edge Deployment)Once the Teacher is well-trained, you perform Knowledge Distillation and deploy the lightweight Student Agent for fast, real-time inference.
5. Run Distillation (Implied Phase):Although there's no single "distillation" entry script, the process is initiated after the Teacher is trained.
6. The following modules are central to this:src/distillation/knowledge_distiller.py: Implements the $\text{KD}$ loss (e.g., matching the Student's policy/value outputs to the Teacher's).
7. src/distillation/hybrid_feedback.py: Likely generates $\text{KD}$ targets or correction signals to guide the Student's training.
8. src/arch/student_network.py: The simpler, lightweight network that learns from the Teacher's outputs.
9. Deploy for Inference:Use the secondary entry point to load the trained (and possibly distilled) Student network.
10. This simulates deployment on a resource-constrained "edge" device (Chapter 6).Bashpython main_edge_deployer.py
11. Run Experiments (Advanced)To validate the thesis claims, you would run the provided experiment
12. scripts:Ablation Study (Chapter 9):Test the impact of individual components (SGT, PER, KD) by running with and without them.
13. python experiments/run_ablation_study.py
Scalability Test (Chapter 8):Evaluate how the agent performs as the size or complexity of the scheduling problem increases.
python experiments/run_scalability_test.py
Baseline Comparisons:Compare your DRL++ method against standard approaches like FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) or other DRL baselines.Bashpython experiments/run_baselines.py
